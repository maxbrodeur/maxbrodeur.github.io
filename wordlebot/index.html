                <p>Following the trend, my parents started playing the <i> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html">Wordle</a> </i> game. If you're not familiar, it's like the Mastermind boardgame but with words: there's a secret word you have to guess in at most 6 attempts. The letter is colored green if its in the right position, yellow if it's not at the correct position but in the word, and black if it isn't in the word. However, a difference is the guess must be a valid word, thus can't be some jibber jabber such as "jmkals".</p>
                <p>Instead of attempting to beat my Dad's glorious 3 attempt guesses, and instead of studying for my midterm, I spent the weekend coding a <i>Wordle Bot</i> while learning about Python's webscraping capabilities with <i><a href="https://www.selenium.dev/">Selenium</a></i>.</p>
                <p>In hindsight, this probably wasn't the most efficient strategy... My midterm still went pretty well though! :)</p>

                <p>First, we need to filter the UK english dictionary to obtain a list of 5 letter words. To find a good first guess, we can refer to letter frequencies in that list. We find the word which contains the most frequent letters to be: <i>arose</i>. Here is a short Jupyter Notebook yielding exactly this result:</p>

                <p>With the Selenium webdriver tools, the program opens up the browser right in front of you and interacts with the website. Here is what a full run looks like:</p>

            <div class="media_wrap video_wrap">
                <video class="rl_media" muted autoplay loop>

                <p>Splendid! Notice the recovery when the generated guess is "lloyd", which isn't in Wordle's word list. ;) </p>
                <p>But my Dad did it in 3 guesses... Since the program works by randomly choosing words in the list given the constraints, let's see how it performs if we run it again.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="media_wrap video_wrap">
                <video class="rl_media" muted autoplay loop>
                    <source src="./assets/video1.mp4" type="video/mp4">
                </video>

            <div class="section_text">
                <p>Impressive! Ah-ha! In your face <i>Dad</i>! :)</p>
                <p>An interesting nuance in this run are the constraints set by the guess "<i>photo</i>" as it contains twise the letter <i>'o'</i>, but once in green and once in black. It is important to treat this case in order to prevent the program from filtering out the answer from the list of words.</p>
                <p>We see that the program works well even without <i>arose</i> as our first guess:</p>
